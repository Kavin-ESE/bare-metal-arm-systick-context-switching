# bare-metal-arm-systick-context-switching
Implemented a simple ARM Cortex-M scheduler in assembly using SysTick for context switching. Manually built task stacks, saved/restored CPU registers, and switched SP between tasks. Learned low-level boot flow, exception handling, and how bare-metal multitasking works internally.
